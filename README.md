# Database
This project uses a SQLite database. The database is in quotes_database.db file, and all database models are declared in database.py file. A new database can be created and prepopulated by running the prepopulate_database.py file (remove the existing database before trying to create a new one). The requirements.txt includes all project dependencies so far.
