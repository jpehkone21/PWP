## Meeting 2.
* **DATE:** 18.2.2025 
* **ASSISTANTS:** Ivan Sanchez

### Minutes
*Summary of what was discussed during the meeting*

Database design and implementation were assessed. Overall it was ok, but the relation and use of foreign keys between quotes and creatures/humans/animals was incorrect. It was agreed that we fix it and send message to Ivan whether we got it to work. 

### Action points
*List here the actions points discussed with assistants*
- Instructions for installing requirements was missing
- Diagram about the database models needs changes (arrows should be the other way around, need to add text if relations are one-one, many-one etc.)
- The relation between quotes and creature/humans/animals was done incorrectly. Foreign key should be only in creatures/humans/animals and not in quotes.
- (Suggestion that the name attribute could be the primary key for creatures/humans/animals)
- (Suggestion that creature types could be constrained in db or in api)
